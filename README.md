# News Analysis App

This app is designed to help users gain a deeper understanding of how different news outlets cover the same stories, by analyzing the content of their articles and identifying key themes, topics, and perspectives.

The app retrieves the latest articles from a selection of news outlets and uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key information. It then compares the results across different sources to help users identify patterns and differences in coverage.

The app aims to promote media literacy and help users make more informed decisions about the news they consume. It is an open source project and welcomes contributions from developers, data scientists, and anyone interested in furthering its mission.
